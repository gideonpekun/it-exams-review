I am a talker, I can speak for hours on most topics without missing words but I donâ€™t know how to write, I wish I could write more.  This blog is for me to improve on my writing and write more about my work. 

Over the course of a decade in IT, I have written and passed more than 30 Certs by just getting information on Google, YouTube, Reddit, Podcasts, Twitter, IT blogs, Slack and Discord channels. Bulk of my knowledge and skills I have gotten from self-study and building a robust HomeLab. 

I will be discussing and sharing the links to resources I use for work and nailing certifications.
