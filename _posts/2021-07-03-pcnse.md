I took the **_Palo Alto Networks Certified Security Engineer (PCNSE)_** exam recently and it was a tough exam though thankfully I passed. Primarily, it was a difficult exam for me because I only had hands on experience using _PAN-OS_ from setting up a GNS3 lab and not production experience, so topics such as Panorama which features prominently in the exam I knew from just the Study Guide and videos.
