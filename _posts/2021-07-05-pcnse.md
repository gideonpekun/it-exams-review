I took the **_Palo Alto Networks Certified Security Engineer (PCNSE)_** exam recently and it was a tough exam though thankfully I passed. Primarily, it was a difficult exam for me because I only had hands on experience using _PAN-OS_ from setting up a GNS3 lab and not production experience, so topics such as Panorama which features prominently in the exam I knew just from the Study Guide and videos. 

I relied on four resources that I have linked below in addition to running _PAN-OS_ VM in my home lab. The list signify in ascending order how relevant the materials were to passing the exam. 

As with other certifications I had studied and sat for, I normally start the search for information on sub Reddit groups then move to Discord channels if they are available.  It took approximately 5 months to prepare for this because of work and other certs I was also preparing for but I believe this is achievable within a month or less of study and prior experience.



1. [**_INE's Palo Alto Networks Firewall Training_**](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/93bb7fc7-8a65-4e9e-9ee0-c2eb7070fcec/palo-alto-networks-firewall), I started with this because of the INE Business subscription I have from the office.  This helped in setting up the lab and I replicated almost the same network Piotr created in his training. Overall, it was an okay training. 


2. [**_Palo Alto Networks Live Community channel on YouTube_**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPRouchFt58TZnjoI65aelA), the wealth of information on Palo Alto Networks NGFW features on this channel is incredible. 


3. [**_The PCNSE Study Guide_**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/datasheets/education/pcnse-study-guide.pdf), Well, you won't pass without understanding or knowing the study guide, it is that important, the other materials only helped in making the exam domains clear.


4. [**_Palo Alto Networks Beacon_**](https://beacon.paloaltonetworks.com/student/catalog), this is simply the best resource for Palo Alto Networks, it has the most to date, simplified and interactive information on Palo Alto Networks and also it is completely free.
