I decided to take the VMware vSAN Specialist exam after watching a Youtube video by [**Charles Chow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7taTkgsn00). In order to gain the VMware Specialist - VSAN badge, a candidate needs to sit for and pass the _VMware vSAN 6.7 Specialist (5V0-21.19)_ exam. 
I opted for the Pearson Vue online proctoring and took the test at home. I am glad to have passed the exam easily.

Apart from having hands on experience in deploying and managing a vSAN environment(not required to pass IMO), the following links helped in passing the exam.

1. [**_vSAN Architecture 100 series playlist_**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwkgfjHppDux1XhPB8pW3vS43Aglfq2c)
2. [**_Awesome vSAN - A Community List of AWESOME VMware vSAN Resources_**](https://github.com/valdecircarvalho/awesome-vsan)
3. [**_vSphere 6.7 Configuration Limits_**](https://configmax.vmware.com/guest?vmwareproduct=vSphere&release=vSphere%206.7&categories=7-0)
4. [**_VMware vSAN Documentation_**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSAN/index.html)

I was surprised after passing that there is no option to download a  certificate for the vSAN Specialist on Certmetrics, the only evidence of successfully passing is the badge from [_Credly_](https://www.credly.com/badges/16a6bbca-acc3-4a0b-9f3a-fad5b0eab74f/public_url). 

Overall, it is a good exam and I recommend it to any VCP that wants to validate his/her vSAN knowledge.
